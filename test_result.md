# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: Build TaskMaster - Intelligent Task Manager mobile app with minimal, non-distractive UI using neutral colors and basic CRUD operations for tasks.

## backend:

        - agent: "main"
        - comment: "Implemented Task model with enums for Priority, Category, TaskStatus. Added complete CRUD API endpoints: POST /api/tasks (create), GET /api/tasks (list with filtering), GET /api/tasks/{id} (get), PUT /api/tasks/{id} (update), DELETE /api/tasks/{id} (delete). Includes filtering by category/priority/status and sorting options."

        - agent: "testing"
        - comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: All API endpoints working correctly. Tested: 1) API root endpoint (/api/) - returns proper TaskMaster message, 2) Task creation with full and minimal data - proper UUID generation and field validation, 3) Task retrieval (list and individual) - correct response format, 4) Task updates (full and partial) - proper field updates and timestamp handling, 5) Task deletion - proper cleanup and response, 6) Filtering by category/priority/status - all filters working, 7) Sorting by various fields (title, created_at, etc.) - ASC/DESC ordering works, 8) Error handling - proper 404 responses for non-existent tasks, 422 for validation errors. All 8/8 test categories passed successfully."

Read - both list and individual task retrieval working with proper filtering (category, priority, status) and sorting (title, created_at, due_date). Update - partial and full updates working correctly with proper timestamp updates. Delete - proper task removal with appropriate success/error responses. MongoDB integration working seamlessly. All edge cases tested including invalid enum values (returns 422), non-existent task operations (returns 404), and minimal vs full task data."

Comprehensive testing performed on all CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and error handling. Created backend_test.py with full test suite. All 8/8 test categories passed. The backend is ready for frontend integration. Key findings: 1) All API endpoints respond correctly with proper status codes, 2) Task model validation working (UUID generation, enum validation, timestamps), 3) MongoDB integration seamless, 4) Filtering by category/priority/status functional, 5) Sorting by multiple fields working, 6) Error handling robust (404 for missing resources, 422 for validation errors). No critical issues found. Backend implementation is production-ready."
